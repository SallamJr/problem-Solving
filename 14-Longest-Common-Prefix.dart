Approach
Initial Prefix:

Start by assuming the entire first string is the longest common prefix.
Iterate Through the Strings:

Compare the current prefix with each string in the array.
Gradually reduce the prefix by trimming characters from the end until it matches the beginning of the current string.
Early Exit:

If at any point the prefix becomes an empty string, you can immediately return \\ because it means there's no common prefix.

To solve the problem of finding the longest common prefix among an array of strings, we need to identify the longest sequence of characters that is common across all strings, starting from the beginning.

Explanation
Start with the First String:

We assume the first string in the list is the longest common prefix.
Example: For [\flower\, \flow\, \flight\], we start with \flower\.
Iterate Over the Array:

For each subsequent string, compare it with the current prefix.
Use the indexOf method to check if the current prefix is the beginning of the string (indexOf(prefix) == 0).
If it's not, trim the last character from the prefix and check again.
Trim the Prefix:

The substring method is used to reduce the prefix if it doesn't match the beginning of the current string.
If the prefix becomes empty during this process, return an empty string as there is no common prefix.
Return the Result:

Once all strings have been processed, the remaining prefix is the longest common prefix.
Example Walkthrough
For [\flower\, \flow\, \flight\]:

Start with \flower\.
Compare with \flow\: The prefix reduces to \flow\.
Compare with \flight\: The prefix reduces to \fl\.
Final result: \fl\.
For [\dog\, \racecar\, \car\]:

Start with \dog\.
Compare with \racecar\: The prefix reduces to \\ since there's no common prefix.
Final result: \\.
Time Complexity
O(S), where S is the sum of all characters in the array of strings. The algorithm compares characters only until it finds a mismatch.
Space Complexity
O(1), as we are modifying the prefix in place and not using any additional space that grows with the input size.
This approach efficiently finds the longest common prefix by gradually reducing the prefix size while ensuring it matches the beginning of each string. If no common prefix exists, the function quickly exits with an empty string.
